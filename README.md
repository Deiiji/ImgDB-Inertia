What is ImgDB-Inertia?
----------------------

ImgDB-Inertia is a project to make ImgDB better fit into Inertia / SecondLife for checking texture similarity

Potential applications inside SecondLife
----------------------------------------

+ Checking image signatures to determine if a clothing item was copybotted
+ Checking if an avatar is using clothing layer protection without relying on a tag database (compare the baked and unbaked layers)
+ Scanning for similar or duplicate textures / snapshots in one's inventory
